# JavaScript: Linked List

Implement a doubly linked list

Like an array, a linked list is a simple linear data structure. Several 
common data types can be implemented using linked lists, like queues, 
stacks, and associative arrays.

A linked list is a collection of data elements called *nodes*. In a 
*singly linked list* each node holds a value and a link to the next node. 
In a *doubly linked list* each node also holds a link to the previous 
node.

You will write an implementation of a doubly linked list. Implement a 
Node to hold a value and pointers to the next and previous nodes. Then 
implement a List which holds references to the first and last node and 
offers an array-like interface for adding and removing items:

* `push` (*insert value at back*);
* `pop` (*remove value at back*);
* `shift` (*remove value at front*).
* `unshift` (*insert value at front*);

To keep your implementation simple, the tests will not cover error 
conditions. Specifically: `pop` or `shift` will never be called on an 
empty list.

If you want to know more about linked lists, check [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list).

These tests use jasmine-node, which is a testing framework written for Node.js.

You will need:

* Node.js
* The Node Package Manager (NPM)
* jasmine-node

You can install both Node.js and NPM with a download from nodejs.org: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Use NPM to install jasmine-node:

    npm install jasmine-node -g

To work on an exercise, change to the directory of the exercise:

    cd hello-world

This contains the files for the exercise.

    .
    ├── README.md
    └── hello-world.spec.js

To run a test file, pass it as an argument to the `jasmine-node` command:

    jasmine-node hello-world.spec.js
